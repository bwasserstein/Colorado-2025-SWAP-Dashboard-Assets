Adaptive capcity charts were pulled from completed CCVI Assesment forms located in the CCVI Assements 2024/2025 folder downloaded on 4/17/25. Figure 1, the simpler bar chart, is saved as latin name of species separated by "_" and suffixed with "_CCVIChart1" (e.g. catastomus_latipinnus_CCVIChart1). The "Figure 2.  Adaptive Capacity as represented by the 37 factors from Modules C through I, color-coded by level of adaptive capacity. " is similarly saved but with the suffix "_CCVIChart2" (e.g. catastomus_latipinnus_CCVIChart2). NOT ALL SPECIES ASSESSMENT FORMS HAD A FIGURE 2. 

Additionally, few species had 2 forms filled out for the same species. If they were different the more recent one was chosen. If no date was listed, the one with more information in assessment notes on the Report Results tab was chosen. If the files were the same, but one had the Figure 2 and one did not, the form that included figure 2 was chosen.
